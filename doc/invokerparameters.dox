/*! \page invokerparameters Advanced Invoker Command Line Parameters

This section describes some of the invoker command line parameters. For a full list, use \c invoker \c --help.

\section type --type TYPE

TYPE chooses the type of booster used. Qt-booster may be used to     launch anything. Possible values for TYPE:
- m = Launch a MeeGo Touch application.
- q = Launch a Qt application.
- d = Launch a Qt Declarative (QML) application.
- e = Launch any application, even if it's not a library.

\section delay -d, --delay SECS

After invoking sleep for SECS seconds (default 0). 

\section respawn -r, --respawn SECS

After invoking respawn new booster after SECS seconds (default 3, max 10).
This can be used if the application is very slow to start up, and respawning the booster interferes

\section waitterm -w, --wait-term

Wait for launched process to terminate (default). The invoker is not
really needed after the application process has been started, but some
processes can get confused if the invoker exits immediately. For
example, Upstart reacts to invoker exit by trying to launch the same
application again.

\section nowait -n, --no-wait

Do not wait for launched process to terminate.

\section globalsyms -G, --global-syms

Places symbols in the application binary and its libraries to the global scope. See RTLD_GLOBAL in the dlopen manual page.

\section daemonmode -o, --daemon-mode

Notify invoker that the launched process is a daemon. This resets the
oom_adj of the process. The flag is not needed if something like
Upstart already takes care of daemonization.
